The files we changed are: 

proc.c
proc.h
syscall.c
syscall.h
sysproc.c
usys.S
user.h
defs.h
lab1.c


For each file, we had to add the system call to each file, and add the code for the scheduler, waitpid, mywait and myexit.

We had to add all the definitions in the .h files, and added all the code in the .c files. proc.c contained most of the code.
